            <h2>Send Section</h2>
            <p><strong>This is my first blog post.<br></strong>
                I am currently writing this in Visual Studio Code 2, on the train, on my way home from work.<br>
                I've settled on the "Shreddit" name for the site because I like that it is a cross between Shred and Reddit, the social media website. <br>
                This site is mostly for me to practice coding and learn/ perfect things, but I also think it could be a cool, fun website to actually have running. <br>
                I'm not sure where this will go, but I guess that is the beauty of it. I'm excited. :) </p>

            <p>Second Blog post<br>
                I've been pretty sidetracked from this project coding in general. I had my computer stolen while on a work trip so getting set back up really sucked. I'm back though and ready to go.</p>
